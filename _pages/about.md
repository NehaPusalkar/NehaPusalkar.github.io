I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in Robotics and AI at the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute. I am advised by Dr. Julie A. Adams in the Human Machine Teaming Lab.

I graduated with a Masters in Robotics from University of Michigan in May 2021. At UM, I worked at the Laboratory for Progress directed by Professor Chad Jenkins, and at the UM Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles. I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from VNIT Nagpur, India in May 2018.

My primary research interests are Multiple Robot Systems, Distributed AI, Planning under Uncertainty.
